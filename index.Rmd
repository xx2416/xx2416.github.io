# Hi everyone

* Welcome to Xicheng Xie's website. I am a first-year MS student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics. I like my major biostatistics. Cleaning data and trying to discover the logic behind the data make me feel satisfied. 
* I am a sneakerhead, a basketball and workout fanatic. Study, workout, eat, and sleep. I am living an extraordinary boring life, which is very **exciting**.
